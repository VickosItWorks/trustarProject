          "Translume will develop an extremely robust, inexpensive micro flow cytometer (mFCM) for quantitative detection of phytoplankton. This device will be designed to be deployed on oceanographic platforms, such as moored buoys, or autonomous vehicles of the type presently used by our collaborator Dr. Needoba at the NSF Center for Coastal Margin Observation and Prediction. Our microflow cytomer will be optimized for low power consumption and autonomous long-endurance operations. Previous flow cytometers designed for at-sea applications are physically large and have considerable consumable needs. While the core of these instruments may be small, they require ancillary systems that drastically increase their size, weight, and power consumption. In order to reduce size and power consumption, our mFCM will operate without any pump. We will rely on sea motion (either waves or motion of the vehicle) to drive the fluid (sample and sheath) through our cytometer. The flow velocity will be unsteady and at times may be severely pulsed. This mode of operation would normally be considered unacceptable, as it would drastically affect the flow characteristics such as sheathing, as well as phytoplankton size and density measurements. However, our device will include an integrated optical flow velocity measurement capability that will remediate these shortcomings. The complexity associated with this velocity measurement capability, and the related power consumption, is only a small fraction of that of a pump-operated system. Thus the practical challenges of oceanic deployments will be significantly reduced. Expenditure of sheathing fluid will be minimized using advanced three-dimensional microfluidic design features; or potentially completely eliminated using a sheath-less design. Extreme robustness will be insured by creating all elements (microfluidic optics, structural frame) in a single fused silica monolith providing permanent and exact alignment of all elements.",

          "The major challenges associated with additive manufacturing (AM) are an ability to qualify parts and the costs associated with the technology. Our team will study and mature technologies as detailed below to develop an ecosystem for the qualification of AM machines, which in turn supports the certification of part production. Additive manufacturing offers unique opportunities for the aviation industry in the fabrication of original components and replacement parts. Aggressive use of metals AM has, for example, allowed the rapid development and production of new launch vehicle designs, at substantially reduced costs. Aviation has unique challenges, such as higher production volumes, but the potential value of integrating AM into aviation manufacturing is clear. To implement the ecosystem for AM qualification, the team will run a set of six multi-disciplinary projects. Each of these projects will address a current barrier to AM process qualification, and efficient production. AM Flaw Management: Flaw (dominated by pore structure) management is currently the most important need in the fabrication of aviation components subjected to fatigue. This project will define the processing window to achieve flaw/porosity control within defined limits and further demonstrate how process optimization can control porosity levels within that processing window. Mechanical properties such as fatigue will be used to quantify the effects of porosity and build the necessary data portfolio for process qualification. Qualification Aware Process Maps: There is a concern in the aero industry that any changes in process variables require a full re-qualification of an AM process and this is leading to qualification efforts focusing on a single process variable set (usually defined by a machine manufacturer). This project will address this concern by defining multiple process variable points within the process window (Project #1) and developing data for each of them for qualification. Qualification Aware Post Processing: Post processing of an aviation part can easily cost as much as the additive fabrication itself, yet little science has been applied to post processing of AM parts. In particular, there is an important coupled relationship between AM processing and post processing to achieve optimal cost and performance. This project will investigate and implement more efficient post-processing methods that support qualification. Database Analytics: This project will compile data from all members on process-structure- property relationships, with a focus on porosity and fatigue. This project will apply data science to develop a model for qualification that will be used in training and education (next project). Training and Education: We will disseminate project results across University, Small Business and Partner Company and Government Laboratory team members and will train small businesses looking to become Tier 1 AM suppliers. Dissemination will occur through student and industry employee exchanges executed at the academic team member sites. We will also train potential AM component suppliers (subcontractors) to achieve various defined levels (tiers) of AM expertise and thus qualify their processes using the results of these projects. Scaling to Production: A critical barrier to widespread use of AM in aviation manufacturing is the scaling from research-based component fabrication to small-scale production at the rate of hundreds or thousands of parts per year. This project will investigate optimal configurations of combined pre-processing, processing and post-processing cells that exploit robotic automation and its integration with human workers.",

          "This project aims to transform manufacturing processes in commercial aviation that have traditionally been resistant to automation. These manual processes have become significant bottlenecks in an increasingly efficient and automated production pipeline, while posing significant risk to the health and safety of human workers. This project team aims to address the challenge of assisting skilled aviation workers in these tasks by developing technologies that augment and complement human capabilities rather than attempting to entirely automate them. Specifically, the project will improve the efficiency and ergonomics of these manual processes through the process-centered development of a flexible human-robot collaboration platform that will provide skilled aviation technicians with intelligent assistance. The project team will develop this platform and its applications across a range of manufacturing processes that are central and critical to the aerospace industry, focusing on for processes for development and testing: (1) riveting, (2) hand layup, (3) sanding, and (4) the installation of interior furnishings. The research activities will center around five key challenges. First, the research team will develop a shared human-robot collaboration platform that will integrate core capabilities for task assistance and that will serve as the basis for development to address the other research challenges. The remaining technical challenges will involve extending the shared platform with specific capabilities to support each of the four manufacturing processes in order to significantly improve process efficiency and worker ergonomics and its assessment in the laboratory and demonstration at Boeing facilities for technology transfer. Specifically, addressing each of these challenges will involve (1) modeling the manufacturing process, such as hand layup, (2) developing human-robot task plans that optimize efficiency and ergonomics, (3) developing specific capabilities for the collaborative robot platform, (4) carrying out laboratory assessments of the solutions, and (5) working with Boeing engineers to transfer research products into manufacturing environments.",

          "The aeronautics industry has been challenged on many fronts to increase efficiency, reduce emissions, and decrease dependency on carbon-based fuels. With subsonic transports serving as the dominant contributor to the fuel consumption and carbon footprint of global aviation, the need for environmentally-responsible transportation has been met with a boom of research in the field of aircraft propulsion electrification across industry, government, and academic organizations. However, adoption of electrified propulsion systems for large commercial aircraft today is unattainable, due to the lack of motors and power electronics appropriately sized for these vehicles, high weight requirements of conventional electrical energy storage systems, and new principles required to design these classes of aircraft. The mission of the Center for High-Efficiency Electrical Technologies for Aircraft (CHEETA) program is to develop, mature, and design disruptive technologies for electric commercial aviation. The associated technologies being researched include distributed aero-propulsion system integration, high-efficiency electrochemical power conversion, flight-weight electric machines and power electronics, materials and systems for superconducting high-efficiency power transmission, and methods for complex system integration and optimization. Additionally, the current program is investigating the use of unconventional energy storage and power generation architectures, such as liquid hydrogen fuel and high-efficiency fuel cell systems. The research program provides a direct line-of-sight to not only achieving, but potentially even exceeding the aviation community goals for transition to alternative propulsion and energy through convergence of various novel technologies. The end result of maturation and integration of these technologies is an aircraft system with a quiet, efficient propulsion system that produces zero carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter emissions at the vehicle level.",

          "Urban Air Mobility (UAM), a safe and efficient air transportation system for on-demand mobility (ODM) from small package delivery to air taxis, has arrived as the next frontier in air transportation. Market studies have established economic factors with NASA setting forth a Grand Challenge in the 2022 timeframe. With higher production volumes and smaller size than commercial aircraft, studies have identified need for next generation composite materials and manufacturing methods to meet ODM goals of affordability, safety and lifecycle emissions. A new paradigm shift is proposed to innovate highly aligned short fiber composites that can be stamped like sheet metal at high rate while retaining aerospace properties and tailorability in lightweight composite structures. The University of Delaware (UD-CCM) has developed a highly-aligned short fiber-based composite feedstock (&gt;57% volume fraction) that enables automotive-like production processes at high rate (i.e. 1 minute cycle times) with properties equivalent to aerospace-grade continuous fiber composites. Single step metal-like forming of tailored blanks into complex geometries has been demonstrated. An automated pilot facility to convert fibers to parts at rate will be leveraged to create new prepreg and tailored blanks formats for model validation, database generation and forming demonstrations. The Technical Challenge is to develop a science-based part/process design methodology for TuFF composites meeting aerospace performance at automotive manufacturing rates, as well as demonstrate at rate manufacturing capability of TuFF complex geometry parts. A combined experimental and modeling approach is leading to TuFF composite part design and manufacturing guidelines for industry transition. Modeling aspects will focus on visualizing and understanding fiber-scale mechanisms of alignment during processing, mechanical loading and rate dependent forming of highly aligned short fiber layers, development of experimentally validated constitutive models, process and part design.",

          "The next generation of aerospace systems requires materials and structures that combine high performance at high utilization in short missions with the possibility of high rate production, without excessive non-recurring cost, to allow for rate flexibility and shorter structural life cycles. The development of materials and structures that offer this flexibility in rate without negatively influencing performance and economic viability will require a matching and overlapping experimental and computational design approach. The objective is to go from Atom to Airframe to Spaceframe for thermoplastic unidirectional tape based fastener-free assemblies. Thermoplastic composites are chosen as the focus because these materials allow for reversible fusion bonding in every stage of their life cycle after synthesis. Our strategy is to combine multi-scale computational approaches with multi-scale experimental activities to develop an understanding of and capabilities to manufacture custom unidirectional thermoplastic tape. This tape will be the basis for our high-rate multiple-technology manufacturing approach validated by the production of two representative demonstrators for urban air mobility vehicle structures. The multi-disciplinary team will work in an integrated manner to effectively combine computational approaches with experimental approaches at each stage of characteristic manufacturing flows. The team aims for tools and technology to quantify the thermo-rheological aspects of unidirectional tape-based production and assembly of aerospace quality thermoplastic components as well as for validated tools for unidirectional tape-based thermoplastic preform and part design and manufacture. The work will be used to design and build two demonstration structural parts characteristic for urban air mobility vehicles.",

          "Aviation&#x19;s future will likely see the integration of a wide variety of Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) systems including Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) for cargo/delivery, personal air vehicles, and commercial Urban Air Mobility (UAM) vehicles. However, substantial challenges exist that could delay (and possibly prevent) these developments and thus research is needed in a variety of areas to leverage technologies in autonomy, Air Traffic Management (ATM), multi-redundant flight systems architectures, and advanced wireless connectivity like 5G to meet these challenges. The goal of this ULI project is to develop new technologies and innovative operational concepts which will ensure safe, secure and robust integration of autonomous vehicles into Advanced Air Mobility-tailored transportation infrastructure. All this must be done while maintaining inter-operability with current civil air transportation systems and associated safety standards. The project is organized into four Technical Challenges (TCs) areas designed to provide unique UAM solutions and a transition roadmap for industry and government to utilize research product output. 1 Safe Perception, Coordination, Planning, and Navigation is the basis of our first technical challenge TC1: The full-scale incorporation of low-altitude Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and UAM systems introduces unexplored safety risks, and necessitates high-reliability sensing, coordination, planning, and navigation approaches to cope with dynamic and unpredictable environments. TC1 addresses the amalgamation of various algorithms (and software components) that correspond to addressing disparate technological challenges. These challenges include operating at different time-scales and integrating dissimilar types of data into a unified, holistic format compatible with both existing and near-future embedded flight control system for UAV and UAM systems. 2 Secured autonomy our second technical challenge TC2: For future secured autonomy in UAM systems resolving issues surrounding operations in potentially hostile environments with highly dynamic situations, the system&#x19;s inherent heterogeneity among cyber and physical components, the large-scale overall system, and limited computation/processing capability of individual components poses complex challenges. TC2 investigates the system&#x27;s capability to handle malicious cyber-physical activities based on the strength and potential for damage and categorized into five levels: (1) Low (2) Guarded (3) Elevated (4) High and (5) Severe. Accordingly, cyber-attack detection and accommodation techniques will be developed while considering the overhead added to the system by the cyberattack detection algorithms as a percentage value of memory, time, and power. 3 Verification &amp; Validation (V&amp;V) and Test &amp; Evaluation (T&amp;E) is the third challenge, TC3: The hybrid dynamics of complex cyber-physical systems within UAM networks are difficult to model and analyze to enable reasoning concerning human interference, intervention, guidance, and assistance. Therefore, novel V&amp;V and T&amp;E tools that are scalable and modular, and that can flexibly accommodate evolving specifications and requirements, are needed Effective V&amp;V and T&amp;E frameworks in TC3 provide provable guarantees of correctness in the UAM network, improve safety, and provide certification methodologies for autonomous operation in the airspace. 4 System integration is the final component we will address in TC4: Proper integration of the emerging secure and safe autonomy algorithms into practical flight software is challenging and complex. Moreover, experimenting developed algorithms in different environments (dynamic simulation system, small-scale Indoor Flight Facility (IFF), and large-scale Outdoor Flight Facility (OFF)) and performing different missions (with dependency analytics, integrated simulation (SIM) and experimental flight tests through fast learning cycles) is the required outcome to ensure robust integration and operations, i.e., a system that the public can trust and accept. The projects&#x19; industry partners play a central and crucial role in TC4.",

          "In pursuit of autonomous aviation systems that can safely and efficiently operate within the National Airspace, this project will develop and demonstrate a framework for providing algorithmic assurances and designing fault detection, isolation, and recovery (FDIR) methods for those components of the autonomy stack that rely on data-driven methods based on machine learning. In the future, autonomous aviation systems, in the form of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) and urban air mobility (UAM) services, are expected to result in more than 2.5 million flights per day. These systems will operate at increased levels of autonomy and will extensively leverage non-traditional software components based on machine learning techniques, in tasks as diverse as visual perception (e.g., to detect other aircraft), intent prediction (e.g., to predict future behavior of other agents), and decision-making and control. Such a proliferation of learning-enabled components (LECs) will be driven by their potential to outperform their traditional, non-learning based counterparts (e.g., for object detection and recognition) and enable entirely new capabilities (e.g., fast decision-making in non-stationary environments). However, LECs can be notoriously brittle in practice (as generalization beyond training data is still a poorly understood property) and largely lack appropriate methods for verification and validation. This tendency of theoretical statistical accuracy but demonstrated fragility in practice represents a key barrier for wider and trusted adoption of LECs. In this context, this project has three objectives: Objective 1: Assurances for Autonomous Systems with LECs: Develop and demonstrate tools and methods to provide assurances for those components within the autonomy stack that rely on machine learning techniques and other similar data-driven techniques. Objective 2: Run-Time Fault Detection, Isolation, and Recovery for LECs: Develop and demonstrate tools and methods to detect faulty operation for LEC-based autonomous aviation systems, and devise new fault isolation/recovery methods for these systems. Objective 3: Airspace Management with LEC-based Autonomous Systems: Develop and demonstrate tools and methods to extend the vehicle-centric assurances and FDIR capabilities devised in Objectives 1 and 2 to the airspace system level.",

          "To enable commercially viable civil supersonic transport (SST) aircraft, innovative solutions must be developed to meet noise and efficiency requirements for overland flight. This research effort consists of a multi-disciplinary team of academic and industrial experts exploring for the first time the potential of small real-time geometric outer mold line (OML) reconfigurations to minimize sonic boom signatures and aircraft drag in response to changing ambient conditions, thereby enabling noise-compliant overland supersonic flight. The team utilizes recent advances in supersonic computational fluid dynamic (CFD) methods, new noise prediction tools, and new design approaches to consider embedded highly energy-dense shape memory alloy (SMA) actuators for local shape modifications to an SST aircraft leading to optimal low boom signature and low drag in different environments. This university-led program will provide strategic leadership toward technology convergence that advances NASA&#x27;s Aerospace Research Mission Directorate&#x27;s (ARMD) research objectives with regard to Thrust 2: &#x1c;Innovation in Commercial Supersonic Aircraft&#x1d; by exploring for the first time enabling low-boom operation across a range of flight conditions via structural adaptivity, and will promote education of the next generation of engineers. The overall research strategy is to pursue three critical areas: the design of configurations for reducing boom, SMA material development and modeling, and technology feasibility demonstration in a relevant environment. Initially, the team will identify potential applications where structure or geometry adaptivity provides a benefit in noise or drag across the entire flight envelope. For selected applications/structural locations, required OML geometry changes will be determined based on analysis of sonic boom ground signature and drag reduction using new design tools, trade studies, and atmospheric sensing techniques. Designs will be developed and evaluated against requirements on loading, stroke length, and operational temperature. New alloy formulations will be developed tailored for both autonomous and controlled actuation modes. As the SMA material development matures, integrated system-level factors will be investigated. Optimized designs for small-scale distributed adaptivity applications of maximum benefit will then be matured and tested, moving toward demonstration of the innovative technology approaches at a TRL 4-5 and showing that sonic booms can be reduced by reconfiguration on demand.",

This will be done by design and evaluation of novel communication techniques at the physical, data link, and networking layers of the communications protocol stack. Our team is applying these techniques and evaluating them in computer simulations as well as in experimental testbed prototypes. In this project we are building analytical, simulation, and measurement tools, and these will be used to assess gains to air traffic management system capacity, efficiency, and resilience. One significant outcome is a prototype dual-frequency-band air-ground radio system that will be flight tested by Boeing in 2020. This radio design is more efficient, and more robust to interference than existing systems. The project consists of six (6) major tasks: Task 1: Develop a multi-band networking Concept of Operations for use in multiple phases of flight and all communication link types. Task 2: Quantify capacity and coverage of existing aviation (and adjacent) frequency bands and technologies, quantify shortcomings and mid- to far-term (~2035) improvements, and assess growth potential. Task 3: Build analysis and simulation software toolboxes and prototypes and assess adaptive link and network performance over multiple frequency bands using multiple communication modes in a hyper-spectral network.

This is accomplished through the integration of real-time observations from autonomous systems, such as drones and urban air taxis, with numerical weather prediction models and flight management and safety systems. To solve this problem, several technical challenges have been identified. These include (1) developing autonomous UAS capable of conducting observations accurately and reliably; (2) determining the number and frequency of required observations and the sensitivity of these observations in data sparse regions of the lower atmosphere; (3) assimilating dense observational data into models in real-time with sufficient resolution and accuracy; (4) developing novel physics-based reduced order models capable of incorporating diverse data sets; and (5) integrating real-time forecasting into UTM and DAA (detect-and-avoid) architectures for path planning and navigation. The goal of this proposed effort is to demonstrate the value of using small UAS to collect measurements of the dynamic and thermodynamic properties of the lower atmosphere at scales that match or exceed the spatio-temporal resolution of today&#x19;s best numerical weather prediction models.",

          "This project will design, build, and test a 1 megawatt electric machine and thermal management system that is targeted for aircraft propulsion applications and achieves a specific power density exceeding 14 kilowatt/kilogram (active mass) with 99% efficiency. The machine will be integrated with its power electronics drive operating at voltages greater than 2000 Volt dc and achieving a 25 power density and 99% efficiency. The machine will be studied as part of an overall aircraft system which will include an energy management system. The system integration work is led by Georgia Tech. After first providing the initial requirements for the mission, they then resized the vehicle based on the preliminary technology goals. Trade studies were performed and showed not only the benefits of distributed propulsion but also the contribution of the hybridization of the system on a regional aircraft. A hybrid-distributed propulsion provided at 15% fuel burn reduction compared to a next generation A320 aircraft. With the addition of boundary layer ingestion (yet to be demonstrated) we can achieve a significant reduction of fuel burn and carbon dioxide emission of 23%. Power electronics work is being performed at Ohio State&#x27;s Center for High Performance Power Electronics (CHPPE) lab. The team is developing advanced technology required to achieve high-efficiency high-power-density power electronics converters that achieve reliable operation with 2 kilovolt dc bus voltage in a harsh working environment. Efforts are in 3 major technology areas: Partial discharge study for power electronics and electric machines at low air density; Power module and power converter designs to achieve high power density; Advanced control strategies and protection schemes for aircraft onboard power The work completed thus far has shown that the target power densities are achievable and most importantly that partial discharge at low ambient pressure can be controlled. The focus on energy storage is to integrate the electro-mechanical thermal characterization methods with the performance, safety and durability of the battery cells. The team at Ohio State&#x27;s Center for Automotive Research is working with the most advanced cell producers to design and demonstrate novel Energy Storage System based on lithium-ion batteries and is optimizing the integration of these cells for the airplane mission. The aim of this technical thrust is: Characterization and modeling of high energy density state of the art and advanced battery technologies based on experimental testing, including energy density assessment, electro-thermal modeling, aging models, analysis of behavior at extreme conditions; Design exploration for high level pack sizing under performance, durability, cost and weight constraints (activity in collaboration with Georgia Tech); Battery Management System for pack control and safe operation, including dynamic power limits estimation of the cells considering temperature and aging, estimation of state of charge and state of health, safe operation at high voltage, cell balancing; Pack Architecture (modules and submodules) that enhances modularity, capability of reconfiguration and adaptation in case of fault, self-diagnosis, and operation with state-of-the-art charging infrastructures. A high performing motor was identified early as one of the challenges of the program. A thorough integration of the mechanical and electromagnetic design were required. The Center of Design and Manufacturing Excellence (CDME) at The Ohio State University was engaged early to work with the University of Wisconsin team to develop the motor. The teams have worked closely to develop a well-integrated design could be made available first in a 200 kilowatt machine and then in a 1 megawatt motor. The team plans to run the 200 kilowatt machine in the laboratory and the 1 megawatt machine at the NASA Electric Aircraft Testbed facility. Thermal cooling for a high megawatt electrical machine is undoubtedly a major challenge. The thermal management system is being addressed by the University of Maryland and North Carolina A&amp;T State University. New designs were investigated and the team kept close communication as to what was needed between these Universities as well as the University of Wisconsin and Center of Design and Manufacturing Excellence (CDME) at The Ohio State University as they worked on the development and production of the 200 kilowatt and 1 megawatt reliable design.",

The BFORE experiment will map 20,000 square degrees in four bands (150, 220, 280 and 350 GHz) with a map sensitivity to polarization at each frequency 3-5 times deeper than the ESA PLANCK satellite. We propose to obtain this data in a single flight in spring 2021 corresponding to the time scale when the next generation ground-based instruments will be completing their initial surveys. BFORE&#x27;s combination of frequency coverage, sky coverage and angular resolution enables a range of science goals. The combination of BFORE and existing low frequency survey data from WMAP, PLANCK and ground-based experiments will enable an improved measurement of the optical depth to recombination, tau, constrain models of reionization and enable precise measurements of the neutrino masses. BFORE will also characterize the properties of the dust polarization with a precision sufficient to clean lower frequency B-mode polarization data to a level corresponding to a tensor to scalar ratio of r &lt; 0.01. In addition, the combination of the frequency coverage and angular resolution of BFORE will enable peculiar velocity measurements or constraints on thousands of galaxy clusters, opening a new window into the evolution of large scale structure.

          "The Cold Atom Laboratory (CAL) launched in 2018 produce clouds of ultra-cold atoms called Bose-Einstein Condensates (BEC&#x19;s), a bizarre state of matter in which atoms behave less like particles and more like waves. On the International Space Station, free from the pull of gravity, scientists are able to observe BEC&#x19;s for much longer than what is possible on Earth, and reach even colder temperatures than what is typically achieved on the ground. To make CAL a reality, technology improvements were implemented to reduce the size of the hardware necessary to create BEC&#x19;s, and to make it sturdy enough to survive the trip to space. Inside the Cold Atom Laboratory, the atom clouds are chilled to about 10 billionths of a degree above absolute zero, or about 10 billion times colder than the &#x1c;average&#x1d; temperature of deep space (typically cited as about 3 Kelvin). This feat is achieved via a 3-step process that begins with using lasers to corral the atoms and slow them down, stealing their energy and reducing the temperature. Radio waves then push away the warmest atoms, and the cloud&#x19;s expansion into very weak atom traps further reduces its temperature. In a BEC, the atoms form a single quantum wave state, and become indistinguishable from one another; this state of matter is not thought to form naturally in the universe. With CAL&#x19;s long observing times, ultra-cold temperatures and a weightless environment, researchers are able to execute a range of experiments that allow them to address some of the most fundamental questions in science, such as the nature of gravity, what is the dark matter and dark energy, and explorations of how complexity arises in the universe. Specific technologies developed by CAL through demonstration in space are: Atom chip Magneto Optical Trap External Cavity Diode Lasers at 767, 780, 785, and 1064 nm. Fiber optic links Packaged optical elements Control electronics An updated Science Module was recently launched and installed in CAL that adds optical Bragg beams for atom interferometry. This CAL upgrade has now demonstrated atom interferometer operation on the ISS, forming the basis of a new generation of exquisitely precise quantum sensors for scientists wishing to explore the universe. Applications of these spaceborne quantum sensors include tests of general relativity, searches for dark energy and gravitational waves, space craft navigation and drag referencing, and gravity science including geodesy of planetary bodies. In the coming months, the capability to perform research using potassium isotopes will also be added to the CAL tool chest.",

          "The Bigelow Expandable Activity Module (BEAM) project is a NASA-industry partnership with Bigelow Aerospace (BA) that developed the first human-rated expandable (also called &quot;inflatable&quot;) space habitat for demonstration on the International Space Station (ISS). The partnership offers NASA substantial cost savings for technology development and for future exploration missions that could use commercially-provided expandable structures and habitats. The BEAM project advances expandable habitat technology by conducting a flight demonstration of a commercially-designed expandable system to achieve Technology Readiness Level 9.0. The primary performance requirement is to demonstrate that the BEAM can successfully launch and berth to the ISS, deploy and expand, and maintain long-term pressure without leakage. The leak performance is defined as both short-term, immediately after deployment, and long-term, for the balance of the mission. BEAM was successfully launched on SpaceX CRS-8 (April 8, 2016), berthed to ISS Node 3 Aft and pressurized on May 28 2016. BEAM successfully completed leak testing and the first crew ingress was June 6, 2016. BEAM, originally certified for a two-year life, has been functioning as expected and in November 2018 NASA and Bigelow Aerospace authorized BEAM for utilization as a stowage module and extended the mission life to the end-of-ISS life. The demonstration consists of the following critical technology objectives: - Launch of a packed expandable structure in a Commercial Resupply Services (CRS) launch vehicle - Safe deployment (expansion) on ISS - Passive air exchange with ISS and an environment inside the BEAM supporting periodic, temporary ingress by the ISS crew - Measure deployment loads during expansion of the BEAM on ISS - Determine radiation protection capability of an expandable structure in low-Earth orbit and demonstrate the performance of advanced active radiation sensors on ISS - Long-term structural performance of expandable shell after exposure to atomic oxygen, vacuum, radiation, and thermal cycling - Demonstrate performance of structural health monitoring systems - Measure long-term leak performance of expandable bladder and bladder joints after launch and deployment cycle - Develop structural and mechanical system requirements for a human-rated expandable module in an external orbital environment and successfully verify those requirements. - Develop crew restraints and mobility aids for Intravehicular Activity (IVA) inside an expandable module. - Develop and implement &quot;housekeeping&quot; procedures for internal surfaces of an expandable module. -Demonstrate utilization as a stowage module.

          "The leading option for extracting oxygen from the Mars atmospheric carbon dioxide is to use a solid oxide electrolyzer, which removes one oxygen atom from the CO2 molecule, ionizes it, and pulls it through a solid electrolyte by applying an electrical potential across the cell. An assessment of the state-of-the-art is being performed to examine past and current development efforts in dry CO2 solid oxide electrolysis (SOE), and to identify key enablers and critical technology gaps for achieving the scale-up, stable performance, and long life needed for future human missions to the Mars surface. Differences in fabrication methods, reliability, scalability, thermal cycling, thermal ramp rates, thermal gradients among the ceramic layers, operating pressure, stack sealing, and longevity are also being evaluated. Structural and thermal modeling of a small stack is leading to new designs for the manifolds to increase structural strength and improve gas distribution through the stack. New manifold designs, 3D printed out of zirconia oxide to match the thermal expansion coefficient in the stack, will be tested for fluid and structural performance. In FY19 and FY20, small scale SOE stacks from multiple commercial providers will be procured and independently tested and characterized in NASA facilities. Oxygen production is part of the AES In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) Technology Project which is developing the component, subsystem, and system technology to enable production of mission consumables from regolith and atmospheric resources at a variety of destinations for future human exploration missions. The overall goals of the ISRU Technology project are to achieve system-level TRL 6 to support future flight demonstration missions and provide exploration architecture teams with validated, high-fidelity answers for mass, power, and volume of ISRU systems. The project&#x27;s initial focus is on critical technology gap closure and component development in a relevant environment (TRL 5) for Resource Acquisition (excavation, drilling, atmosphere collection, and preparation/beneficiation before processing) and Resource Processing &amp; Consumable Production (extraction and processing of resources into products with immediate use as propellants, life support gases, fuel cell reactants, and feedstock for construction and manufacturing). The interim project goal is to complete ISRU subsystem tests in a relevant environment to advance the subsystem to TRL 6. The project end goals are to perform end-to-end ISRU system tests in a relevant environment (system TRL 6) and integrated ISRU-exploration elements demonstrations in a relevant environment. ISRU is a disruptive capability that enables more affordable exploration than today&#x27;s paradigm where all supplies are brought from Earth, and allows more sustainable architectures to be developed. The availability of ISRU technologies can radically change the mission architecture and be the sizing design driver for other complex systems already in development. For example, the current Mars architecture assumes ISRU production of up to 30 metric tons of propellant on the Mars surface in order to reduce the ascent vehicle landed mass by 75 percent and reduce Earth launch needs by at least 300 metric tons. If a decision was made to use storable propellants for the Mars ascent vehicle instead of ISRU-producible oxygen and methane, many other drastic changes to the architecture could be required, such as lander and ascent vehicle size, number of landers needed, surface operations for ascent vehicle fueling, and Mars rendezvous orbit. Other surface systems might become more complex or heavier if they are not designed to take full advantage of ISRU technologies. Examples include a more complex closed-loop life support system if resupply with ISRU water cannot be assumed, or a heavy, built-in habitat radiation shield if a water- or regolith-based shield cannot be added after habitat delivery to the surface. Other system designers may also make decisions that reduce the benefit of incorporating ISRU into the mission, resulting in a larger or more inefficient ISRU system. For example, a non-continuous power source such as solar power would increase the required production rate and peak power of an ISRU plant, thus increasing its size and complexity due to hundreds of start-stop cycles. However, a continuous power source, such as nuclear or solar power with storage, would allow an ISRU plant to operate continuously, thus minimizing its size, complexity, and power draw. These are only a few examples of how the inclusion of ISRU has ripple effects across many other exploration elements. ISRU is also a new capability that has never before been demonstrated in space or on another extraterrestrial body. Every other exploration system or element, such as power, propulsion, habitats, landers, life support, rovers, etc., have some form of flight heritage, although almost all still need technology development to achieve the objectives of future missions. This is another critical reason why ISRU technology development, leading to a flight demonstration mission, needs to be started now, so that flight demonstration results can be obtained early enough to ensure that lessons learned can be incorporated into the final design. This technology development activity was transferred to the STMD Game Changing Development Program in October 2018.",

          "Translume will develop an extremely robust, inexpensive micro flow cytometer (mFCM) for quantitative detection of phytoplankton. This device will be designed to be deployed on oceanographic platforms, such as moored buoys, or autonomous vehicles of the type presently used by our collaborator Dr. Needoba at the NSF Center for Coastal Margin Observation and Prediction. Our microflow cytomer will be optimized for low power consumption and autonomous long-endurance operations. Previous flow cytometers designed for at-sea applications are physically large and have considerable consumable needs. While the core of these instruments may be small, they require ancillary systems that drastically increase their size, weight, and power consumption. In order to reduce size and power consumption, our mFCM will operate without any pump. We will rely on sea motion (either waves or motion of the vehicle) to drive the fluid (sample and sheath) through our cytometer. The flow velocity will be unsteady and at times may be severely pulsed. This mode of operation would normally be considered unacceptable, as it would drastically affect the flow characteristics such as sheathing, as well as phytoplankton size and density measurements. However, our device will include an integrated optical flow velocity measurement capability that will remediate these shortcomings. The complexity associated with this velocity measurement capability, and the related power consumption, is only a small fraction of that of a pump-operated system. Thus the practical challenges of oceanic deployments will be significantly reduced. Expenditure of sheathing fluid will be minimized using advanced three-dimensional microfluidic design features; or potentially completely eliminated using a sheath-less design. Extreme robustness will be insured by creating all elements (microfluidic optics, structural frame) in a single fused silica monolith providing permanent and exact alignment of all elements.",

          "Industry Project The objective of this proposal is to build and characterize an ultra-compact all-electronic cytometer capable of quantifying key cellular components in a complete blood cell count (CBC) including: red blood cells (RBC), white blood cells (WBC), platelets, hemoglobin (hgb) concentration, and hematocrit levels. We propose development of an analyzer that is at least one order of magnitude lower in cost than the state of the art analyzers and requires only 5 &#xb5;l of blood. While RBCs, WBCs, and platelets can be measured electrically, a primary issue hindering impedance cytometry from providing accurate cell counts is the wide signal variation observed due to device-to-device variation, drift due to temperature fluctuations, and off-axis cell translocation in microfluidic channels. Hgb and hematocrit are typically measured based on optical scattering, thus making difficult the realization of a fully electronic platform that can measure the five key parameters mentioned above. Because the combined use of electronics and optics in a single cytometry platform makes miniaturization to a pocket-sized platform difficult, an innovative approach is proposed to improving accuracy of impedance cytometers to measuring the five key parameters above, without requiring additional optics, enabling realization of a pocket-sized platform. We propose use of a multi-frequency impedance cytometer (MFIC) embedded with multiple sensors to enable adaptive self-calibration in conjunction with machine learning to discriminate between RBCs, WBCs, platelets, while estimating hgb and hematocrit levels with less than 5 &#xb5;l of blood. To develop this product, the following objectives are proposed: Objective 1) Integrated microfluidic biosensor fabrication and testing. Objective 2) Developing datadriven software for accurate classification of blood cell types, hemoglobin, and hematocrit using impedance cytometry data. Objective 3) Ultra-compact pocket-sized hardware and smartphone application development. Objective 4) Benchmarking and testing of device accuracy against Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved predicate device. The result of this project will be a working prototype of the proposed analyzer. The intellectual merits are as following: 1) Engineering an all-electronic data-driven bio-sensing platform capable of label-free cell classification. 2) The development of a portable wireless instrument that harnesses machine-learning to accurately classify cells and display results rapidly. 3) The development of ultra-compact modules, which can be applied to a broad range of assays beyond complete blood count analysis. This project will lay the groundwork for development of a commercial product that can improve access to healthcare not only for astronauts in space but also broader society. We will develop an analyzer that is i) at least one order of magnitude lower in cost than the state of the art analyzers, ii) easily wearable/portable (pocket-sized) and lightweight, iii) rapid (provides results within minutes), and iv) easy-to-use and requires only a finger prick of blood. The accessible cost and portability of the proposed inexpensive lightweight user-friendly cytometer to perform automated CBC without the need for professional intervention has a multitude of applications that can significantly impact primary care practice in the United States and globally.",

Radiation Monitoring Devices, Inc. proposes to build an automated, high-throughput instrument to measure changes in protein expression levels in single living cells during passage in a space environment. Commercial libraries of clones expressing GFP (green fluorescent proteins) fused to individual yeast proteins are available for the entire yeast proteome. We will test the feasibility of using fluorescence measurements of these chimeric fusion proteins as an indicator of changes in the expression levels of the endogenous proteins upon exposure to radiation. Our instrument consists of a continuous, multi-well, suspension culture bioreactor that provides yeast clones that are sampled in a microfluidic flow cytometer. Light scattering and fluorescent signals from the yeast particles under flow will activate an in-line cell sorter to collect cells of interest for follow-up analysis. Since the instrument is self-contained, has low power consumption and a small footprint, and uses fluidic based cell separation, it will be suitable for collecting single cell protein expression information in a space laboratory.",

          "Marine phytoplankton are critical in sustaining life on Earth. They are key drivers of the global biogeochemical cycles of carbon and other nutrients, and account for 50% of global photosynthesis. Phytoplankton growth is the fundamental component of the &#x27;ocean biological pump&#x27; one of the two primary mechanisms that cause the ocean to be a significant sink of atmospheric carbon dioxide. Since different taxa occupy different ecological niches, identifying the major influences on the spatial and temporal distribution of phytoplankton groups is necessary to understand ecosystem function and the role of the oceans in global climate. Scientists employ various satellite sensors to measure the amount and distribution of chlorophyll a, an indicator of phytoplankton biomass in the ocean, but satellites only detect near-surface properties and therefore cannot adequately resolve the water column biomass and composition of phytoplankton species. Small and robust sea-based instrumentation (the innovation of this work) provides this information, as well as valuable independent verification of the spaced-based data (&quot;sea truth&quot; data). The objective of this program is to develop a small, inexpensive, submersible, robust microflow cytometer (uFC) for quantitative detection of phytoplankton, to be initially deployed on the NSF Center for Coastal Margin Observation &amp; Prediction coastal ocean observatories (Oregon). The device will be designed for long-endurance autonomous operation. The proposed design has low power requirements, reduces or eliminates consumables, prevents of fouling, and reduces sensitivity to the environment. Our Phase 2 technical objectives are to (1) fabricate a complete uFC with all the subsystems necessary for extended autonomous operational deployment; (2) test our uFC on a coastal station operated by CMOP/OHSU.

The proposed ASES sensor uses a capacitance read-out method to electronically measure the sensor membrane displacement due to the surface stress caused by molecular binding, (e.g., antibody-antigen binding).

          "With retirement of the space shuttle program, microgravity researchers can no longer count on bringing experiment samples back to earth for post-flight analysis. Locker-sized processing facilities, which were typically transported up to and down from the International Space Station during the shuttle era, quite simply consume too much volume, mass, and power to be accommodated as part of both the upmass and downmass on current space transportation vehicles. As a result, more analysis must be accomplished on ISS, which makes on-orbit analytical tools critical to the continued success of microgravity research. The Analytical Cassette transfer Tool (ACT) is a low-cost, disposable device that efficiently transfers experiment samples in a safe and contained manner from unique experiment specific spaceflight hardware to on-orbit analytical tools that enable real-time analysis in microgravity. ACT interfaces with several flight qualified processing payloads to extract experiment samples via a needle-less septum and then allows transfer of those samples into a number of different on-orbit analytical devices, including such instrumentation as the Light Microscopy Module, the Microfluidic Flow Cytometer, a Spectrophotometer, and/or a Mass Spectrometer. Applications in life and environmental sciences include sampling liquid cultures/suspensions or sampling spacecraft water for quality evaluation. ACT functions within or outside of on-orbit gloveboxes to safely transfer any liquid material from one container fitted with the ACT mating receptacle to another container fitted with a receptacle. Its safe, simple, effective, and with its economical advantage, ACT is destined to become the new standard fluid transfer device for the ISS and future space research venues. For the Phase II project, Techshot will develop a flight version of the ACT and subject it to the major spaceflight integration tests.",

          "Medical events happened frequently to astronauts in space. For example, even the Space Shuttle Program alone reported 1867 incidences 1981-1998. Moreover, some events were serious viral/bacterial diseases such as urinary tract, conjunctivitis, acute respiratory, dental, and Varicella Zoster virus infections. Ideally, treatment on astronauts should be based on precise medical information. Meanwhile, blood is one of the most important body fluids related to health and there&#x27;s tremendous information in blood. Blood analysis, if possible, should be the first important step of health monitoring for sick and healthy astronauts. Blood analysis can also be a powerful technique to monitor bone loss and radiation effects. Therefore, NASA should have an in-space, real-time blood analysis capability. However, NASA still doesn&#x27;t have blood analysis capability other than blood gas and electrolyte analysis. This proposal is specifically to develop an in-box blood analysis technology for NASA. As a whole, we believe that the lab-on-a-chip technology is the best choice for multiple blood analysis in space. Therefore, our long-term objective is to develop blood analysis in-a-box using lab-on-a-chip technology specifically for space applications, emphasizing small form factor, lightweight, and autonomous operation to accommodate Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) and International Space Station (ISS) size requirement for medical kits. The specific aims for this project period are to develop space technologies for (a) 5-part WBC (white blood cell) differential, (b) analysis of WBC subtypes (e.g., CD4+ T helper and natural killer cells). Our approach to achieve the goal is to develop the capability of minimally diluted micro flow cytometer to enable a comprehensive WBC differential, and allow detection of fluorescent labels attached to ligands used for cell surface marker for WBC subtype analysis. Embedded in the two specific aims is a research component on the data analysis software. This software has been developed in Matlab to facilitate both quantitative assessment of fluorescence detection and cell and analyte recognition and quantitation. For the last funding years, we worked extensively on searching for a new staining method and optimizing the previously proposed Acridine Orange staining. We successfully developed a series of assays including a 4-part differential assay (i.e., Lymphocyte, Monocyte, Neutrophil, and Eosinophil) with a cocktail staining of fluorescent dyes fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and propidium iodide (PI), a 5-part differential assay (i.e., Lymphocyte, Monocyte, Neutrophil, Eosinophil, and Basophil) with a cocktail staining of fluorescent dyes fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), propidium iodide (PI), and Basic Orange 21, and a specific assay for the rare cell type basophil differential using fluorescent dye Basic Orange 21. The differential assays were investigated in a correlation study with the commercial hematology analyzer, and further verified with the purified WBC types. For the Acridine Orange assay, the differential capability is also extended from 2-part (Lymphocyte and Neutrophil) into 4-part (Lymphocyte, Monocyte, Neutrophil, and Eosinophil). The time and temperature dependence of the Acridine Orange staining are also investigated. Within the project period, we have also explored the possibility of improving the (box) platform in terms of spectroscopic detection. Two different approaches have been implemented; one uses a commercial mini-spectrometer and the other approach uses a 8-channel PMT (photomultiplier) module. Measurement of fluorescent emission spectrum from blood cells stained with the dye assay has been successfully demonstrated on the spectroscopic approach. Single cell fluorescence emission spectrum has been measured on the mini-spectrometer prototype. Distinct spectrums were measured from lymphocyte, neutrophil, and eosinophil cells. Besides, multicolor fluorescent beads have been successfully measured on the 8-color reader. Those two approaches enable detection of multiple fluorophore simultaneously from WBC subtype immune-staining. The additional spectral information should provide better discrimination between multiple fluorophores used simultaneously. It may also provide additional information about the intracellular environment in which Acridine Orange fluorescence occurs, leading to efficient WBC subtype discrimination. For WBC subtypes analysis, we have also successfully demonstrated assays that identified and counted CD4 and CD8 WBCs. In addition, we also developed synthesized peptides specifically targeted for leukocyte cells. The binding peptides were custom-synthesized with a fluorescein fluorophore attached to their n-terminus for binding quantification. A library of 72 potential peptide candidates has been tested using a modified protocol for leukocytes utilized in our studies. Among the results, 4 peptides from our initial library exhibited a 2-3x higher binding strength to the B-cells compared to the other peptides, which confirmed the capability of this approach for WBC subtype analysis.",
